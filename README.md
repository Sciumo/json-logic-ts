# LEAF (Logic Event Agenda Function) Logic  

LEAF is an adaptation of the Event-Condition-Action design pattern for TypeScript with the ability to exchange logic and event handling between logic evaluators.  This enables distributed logic evaluation between processes written in any language with a single lingua franca for logic based on JavaScript and JSON.
